      "review_text": "Beautiful view at iconic Chinaman's hat. Lots of water amenities available. Plenty of cleaning supplies. AC only in bedrooms. Washer/dryer are inside bathroom with no air-other bathroom outside off the lanai. Both bathrooms got over 100 degrees. No screens on living room windows so they could not be opened to let ocean breeze in. Ants and cockroaches on arrival so not having screens on the best windows made the front room and hall unbearable. The place was not ready on arrival and we had to wait several hours. Of the three hosts, we never heard from \"Luke\" or the other one. Nina, who is local, was apologetic, kind, and accommodating when place not ready and allowed luggage drop off and water bottles. She even dropped off malasadas the next day. Place is right on busy highway and much tinier and older than the pics. Washer rusty and could stain if clothes brushed on the rust. Air BnB offered delayed limited help. Would not stay again.",

If you want to go on adventures, Kualoa Ranch is very convenient. However, we stayed at the house which is right on (and has access to) the water. We didn't use any of the water equipment but enjoyed our meals and the warmth of the sun from the private lanai. Nina (the co-host) was located nearby and very responsive when we had questions or needed help. A few things that I'd probably want to know ahead of time (but we still give this place 5 stars): (i) the 3 bedrooms are on the side of the house that faces Kamehameha Highway which is a major thoroughfare (the hosts very helpfully provided ear plugs for those of us who are light sleepers); and (ii) the second bathroom is located on the lanai and not necessarily the \"interior\" of the house (again, not a big deal for us but maybe something families with kids want to know).",

Only downside was one family had to be in the bunk beds but it was manageable. The photos of the beach front are a bit deceiving, we never had the tide out enough to have a sandy area at all. Also it's very very rocky, water shoes are a must. You can walk out in the water for so long and only have it up to your waist area, so not really a swimming beach. But lots of fun anyways! I can see why it's rated so highly, you are paying for the location and waterfront, however the inside is not a 5 star place - that being said the cost is reflective of that and it did not bother us. You are a nice distance to many different areas of the island. We loved that part! The hosts are fantastic and so responsive and proactive. I would definitely stay again!",

It included a lot of amenities and we would definitely book this place again when we come back! Nina was great in checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed at the house!

This vacation was a dream for my parents to have their grand babies in Hawaii together and being able to stay in a house together and wake up to the ocean was the icing on top!!! The house and views are beautiful!! Nina checked in everyday to see if we needed anything and was quick to respond. It does get a little warm in the front room/bathrooms during the day but with the extra fans available we were able to keep it manageable. The water out front is amazing to relax in - it is shallow for quite a while but it was nice sitting in the beach chairs and not having to worry about the kiddos playing in the water. Mahalo for the great experience - I hope we will be able to return soon to Oahu and stay at the home again when we do!!!",

We absolutely loved the private beach, especially with the kids! The water was mostly shallow during our stay but it was perfect for floating on our inflatables! The view was stunning, even from inside the house! We all loved waking up and seeing the view every morning, if I could post pictures I would! All in all this was the perfect place to stay for us! It is on the other side of the island from Honolulu but the peaceful environment and amazing views is exactly what we were looking for! Next time we come back we will for sure be coming back to Nina's place!! I can keep going on forever but all you really need to know is it's worth it!",

Nina was ready with flashlights, candles and dropped off a cooler to refrigerate our food. She checked in with us and responded quickly with answers to our questions our entire stay. She is awesome! We enjoyed the little beach area and snorkeled in the shallow water. We did use the kayaks and SUP, they're well used and good for tooling around close-in but for further trips, the paddles need an upgrade.. but overall fun times! We hope to come back❤️🌺🌴☀️",

There is nothing that beats waking up to beautiful ocean views in the living room and then stepping outside to see the Ko'olau range 😍. The living room gets a bit warm when the sun hits but opening the windows allows the ocean breeze in and it cools it down. We did notice there are also fans in the bedroom closets that could be used in the living room on real warm days. Each bedroom came equipped with an a/c unit to keep the rooms comfortable. We were impressed to find that Nina keeps the house stocked with all the essentials you could possibly need and regularly checked in to ensure we didn't need anything else. From shampoos to laundry detergent to spices to a high chair for my toddler, this home literally had it all. My family of 4 stayed here with another family of 3 comfortably and truly enjoyed all the house had to offer. Kayaking to Chinaman hat island was a highlight",

They even had a high chair which we were grateful for. Plenty of water accessories like water shoes, life jackets, umbrella, cooler, etc. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space around the house. Some days we would just hang out in the house because it was very enjoyable. My 6 year old would spend the whole day playing in the sand until late of night. The owner was always checking to see if everything was good around the house and if we needed anything. Back of the house had an amazing view of the China hat island and the front of the house of the Kualoa Ranch which we recommended doing a tour( we did the movie tour where it showed all the movies made there like Jurassic). Thank you for letting us stay, it felt like home.",

The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you need for cooking! Nina was amazing! She was so easy to communicate with and was always checking in and making sure we had what we needed. We decided to BBQ and were out of propane and Nina was there within 10 min with a new tank. Whenever we had a question Nina was always available with a quick and helpful response. The location of the place was perfect for our family as we prefer a more quiet area as oppose to the busy city of Waikiki. That being said if we wanted to head into Waikiki it was only a 30 min drive. We would definitely stay here again and again!",

There's too much to list off about Luke's place so I will go with the top 3 things about it. 1- Location, location, location. The location of this house is perfect. The beach/ocean in the back and the Jurassic Park themed mountains in the front. I took so many amazing drone shots at this house. 2-Host, our host was local and available for all our needs. Any questions were answered right away. It's so easy for a great Airbnb to be ruined by a bad host. Our host made our first time to Hawaii even better from beginning to end. 3- The house, this house was a perfect mix of modern living and tropical island life. We had everything we needed and more. It really felt like a home vs just a 2nd property someone has to rent out. The host also has available a rugged Mercedes Sprinter van for 10+ people for rent as well. We can't wait to come back again.",

Set in a stunning location with picturesque \"Jurassic Park\" behind you and the Pacific Ocean in front. The house held our family of 8 more than comfortably. The kitchen is very well stocked, great cookware and serving dishes. Our hosts welcomed us with a box full of their piping hot local delicacy and went out of their way to accommodate special requests i.e. camp chairs, coolers, etc. They were always available, but never bothersome. Every outdoor toy you can imagine comes with the property, kayaks, paddle boards, floaties, fishing rods, life jackets, water shoes, even hats! This place was beyond our expectation.
