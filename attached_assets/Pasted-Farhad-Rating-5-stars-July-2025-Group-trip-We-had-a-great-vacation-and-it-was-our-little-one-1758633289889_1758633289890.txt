We had a great vacation, and it was our little one’s first time in Hawaii! This house had everything we needed to keep our toddler happy and entertained from playing in the sand and water to exploring the area. The property also provided canoes and water gear, which made our trip to Chinaman’s Hat even more memorable. Everything was great, highly recommend! Hopefully we’ll be back again soon.

The house manager, Nina, was amazing. Messaged me a couple of days before our stay and then on the day of the arrival. Checked in on us through our stay and even brought us some treats! responded promptly to all requests.
Location is to die for. House is very cute and well furnished. You can spend the whole time just sitting on the beach in front of the house and enjoying the view.

We absolutely loved our stay! Beautiful views! So relaxing and space actually felt larger then photos which is a surprise I usually feel the opposite. Kualoa ranch right across the street is a must! We loved atv tour and enjoyed the Polynesian center. We did check out  waikiki one day and was cool to see but also nice to be on quiet side. House had everything we needed from cooking to fishing and water activities. Front room did get really hot when sun was up a heat pump would be a good investment to cool the house but it didn’t bother me there are many fans. Would definitely be back if we ever make it back to Hawaii! Nina was extremely nice and helpful with anything.

Beautiful view at iconic Chinaman’s hat. Lots of water amenities available. Plenty of cleaning supplies. AC only in bedrooms. Washer/dryer are inside bathroom with no air-other bathroom outside off the lanai. Both bathrooms got over 100 degrees. No screens on living room windows so they could not be opened to let ocean breeze in. Ants and cockroaches on arrival so not having screens on the best windows made the front room and hall unbearable. The place was not ready on arrival and we had to wait several hours. Of the three hosts, we never heard from “Luke” or the other one. Nina, who is local, was apologetic, kind, and accommodating when place not ready and allowed luggage drop off and water bottles. She even dropped off malasadas the next day. Place is right on busy highway and much tinier and older than the pics. Washer rusty and could stain if clothes brushed on the rust. Air BnB offered delayed limited help. Would not stay again.

What a beautiful location! Our first time to O’ahu, we loved this side of the island. The pictures of this house and surrounding area are spot on. Plenty of room for eight of us inside and out. Our co-host, Nina was the best! There was a storm first night we arrived and this side of the island had no power. Nina was ready with flashlights, candles and dropped off a cooler to refrigerate our food. She checked in with us and responded quickly with answers to our questions our entire stay. She is awesome!
We enjoyed the little beach area and snorkeled in the shallow water. We did use the kayaks and SUP, they’re well used and  good for tooling around close-in  but for further trips, the paddles need an upgrade.. but overall fun times! We hope to come back❤️🌺🌴☀️

This beach house was everything we wanted and more! The stunning views were just like the pictures posted.  Waking up to the beautiful sunset almost every day was amazing. Having a private area to relax in was great. We did take our own water shoes but don’t think we needed to as the place is supplied with everything. 
The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you need for cooking! 
Nina was amazing!  She was so easy to communicate with and was always checking in and making sure we had what we needed. We decided to BBQ and were out of propane and Nina was there within 10 min with a new tank. Whenever we had a question Nina was always available with a quick and helpful response. 
The location of the place was perfect for our family as we prefer a more quiet area as oppose to the busy city of Waikiki. That being said if we wanted to head into Waikiki it was only a 30 min drive. 
We would definitely stay here again and again!

The house was excellent for a group of friends who wanted to stay away from the bustle of Waikiki and have a few days away from city life. If you want to go on adventures, Kualoa Ranch is very convenient. However, we stayed at the house which is right on (and has access to) the water. We didn't use any of the water equipment but enjoyed our meals and the warmth of the sun from the private lanai. Nina (the co-host) was located nearby and very responsive when we had questions or needed help.
A few things that I'd probably want to know ahead of time (but we still give this place 5 stars): (i) the 3 bedrooms are on the side of the house that faces Kamehameha Highway which is a major thoroughfare (the hosts very helpfully provided ear plugs for those of us who are light sleepers); and (ii) the second bathroom is located on the lanai and not necessarily the "interior" of the house (again, not a big deal for us but maybe something families with kids want to know).

We stayed here in November for 8 days, we were 2 families (4 adults and 5 kids). We had lots of room and never felt on top of each other. The outside area was amazing. Only downside was one family had to be in the bunk beds but it was manageable. 
The photos of the beach front are a bit deceiving, we never had the tide out enough to have a sandy area at all. Also it’s very very rocky, water shoes are a must. You can walk out in the water for so long and only have it up to your waist area, so not really a swimming beach. But lots of fun anyways!
I can see why it’s rated so highly, you are paying for the location and waterfront, however the inside is not a 5 star place - that being said the cost is reflective of that and it did not bother us. 
You are a nice distance to many different areas of the island. We loved that part!
The hosts are fantastic and so responsive and proactive. I would definitely stay again!

We had been planing our family vacay to Hawaii for many months. We have 3 grown children and one preteen. The house was very comfortable and had all the space that we needed and then some. Even the bunks were comfortable for our 6’2 son because they are extra long singles. Nina was very helpful and gave us lots of recommendations. Everything was perfect with the exception of the weather. All we really had was rain and wind. I would imagine that the beach house is even better with the right forecast.

Our stay was great! With two kids and 4 adults we all had an amazing time. Only downside was the main living area was very hot during the day. Could use an extra portable fan. The place looks just like the pictures.  It was very clean considering the location and temperature. You will find critters and bugs but that’s to be expected. It included a lot of amenities and we would definitely book this place again when we come back!  Nina was great in checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed at the house! 
Turning in an out of the place was a little tricky too as the gate remote was a little wonky. We would have to pull over on the side of the road and get out of the car to close the gate.

Aloha Clara and thank you for your feedback . We truly appreciate it .
When it comes to being hot in the Living room we have 2 big extra portable fans in our closets ready to use and we put a “portable AC unit” in our queen bedroom so it can be used to cool off the main Living room as well if needed.
We are sorry about the gate remote . We wish you would have communicated as this would have been such an easy fix as simply the batteries needed to be changed .
It was an honor hosting you and your family and we hope to see you back soon . Mahalo

The home was everything we hoped it would be and more!! This vacation was a dream for my parents to have their grand babies in Hawaii together and being able to stay in a house together and wake up to the ocean was the icing on top!!! 
The house and views are beautiful!! Nina checked in everyday to see if we needed anything and was quick to respond. It does get a little warm in the front room/bathrooms during the day but with the extra fans available we were able to keep it manageable. The water out front is amazing to relax in - it is shallow for quite a while but it was nice sitting in the beach chairs and not having to worry about the kiddos playing in the water.
Mahalo for the great experience - I hope we will be able to return soon to Oahu and stay at the home again when we do!!!

Leaving a review for this Airbnb was a little difficult. We stay in Airbnbs all the time and never have we had such a pleasant experience. There’s too much to list off about Luke’s place so I will go with the top 3 things about it. 1- Location, location, location. The location of this house is perfect. The beach/ocean in the back and the Jurassic Park themed mountains in the front. I took so many amazing drone shots at this house. 2-Host, our host was local and available for all our needs. Any questions were answered right away. It’s so easy for a great Airbnb to be ruined by a bad host. Our host made our first time to Hawaii even better from beginning to end. 3- The house, this house was a perfect mix of modern living and tropical island life. We had everything we needed and more. It really felt like a home vs just a 2nd property someone has to rent out.
The host also has available a rugged Mercedes Sprinter van for 10+ people for rent as well. We can’t wait to come back again.

Our stay at the Chinaman’s Beach House was absolutely amazing! Everything was just as pictured and it was so beautiful!! Nina was amazing at checking in on us and responding to any questions! She had everything you could need at the Beach House whether it be coffee, shampoo, cooking utensils etc., or even water shoes and sand toys! We absolutely loved the private beach, especially with the kids! The water was mostly shallow during our stay but it was perfect for floating on our inflatables! The view was stunning, even from inside the house! We all loved waking up and seeing the view every morning, if I could post pictures I would! All in all this was the perfect place to stay for us! It is on the other side of the island from Honolulu but the peaceful environment and amazing views is exactly what we were looking for! Next time we come back we will for sure be coming back to Nina’s place!! 
I can keep going on forever but all you really need to know is it’s worth it!

The Chinamans Hat Beach house was everything I expected and more. The views the living room offers are unmatched. There is nothing that beats waking up to beautiful ocean views in the living room and then stepping outside to see the Ko’olau range 😍. The living room gets a bit warm when the sun hits but opening the windows allows the ocean breeze in and it cools it down. We did notice there are also fans in the bedroom closets that could be used in the living room on real warm days. Each bedroom came equipped with an a/c unit to keep the rooms comfortable. We were impressed to find that Nina keeps the house stocked with all the essentials you could possibly need and regularly checked in to ensure we didn’t need anything else. From shampoos to laundry detergent to spices to a high chair for my toddler, this home literally had it all. My family of 4 stayed here with another family of 3 comfortably and truly enjoyed all the house had to offer. Kayaking to Chinaman hat island was a highligh

When looking for a beachfront house I had specific requirements. I wanted a beach right on the property so we could keep eyes on our 6 grandchildren age 14-4 months. It needed space to build sand castles and a grassy play area. Chinamans Hat had everything and more!  The location is easy to get to and services are within 30 minutes drive.  Set in a stunning location with picturesque "Jurassic Park" behind you and the Pacific Ocean in front.  The house held our family of 8 more than comfortably.  The kitchen is very well stocked, great cookware and serving dishes.  Our hosts welcomed us with a box full of their piping hot local delicacy and went out of their way to accommodate special requests i.e. camp chairs, coolers, etc.  They were always available, but never bothersome.  Every outdoor toy you can imagine comes with the property, kayaks, paddle boards, floaties, fishing rods, life jackets, water shoes, even hats!  This place was beyond our expectation.  We will be back!

We stayed in this house for two weeks. The house was perfect by the ocean with its own private water access. It was supplied with plenty of towels, shampoo and coffee. They even had a high chair which we were grateful for. Plenty of water accessories like water shoes, life jackets, umbrella, cooler, etc. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space around the house. Some days we would just hang out in the house because it was very enjoyable. My 6 year old would spend the whole day playing in the sand until late of night. The owner was always checking to see if everything was good around the house and if we needed anything. Back of the house had an amazing view of the China hat island and the front of the house of the Kualoa Ranch which we recommended doing a tour( we did the movie tour where it showed all the movies made there like Jurassic). Thank you for letting us stay, it felt like home.

Our stay at Luke’s was nothing short of magical. We came to spend 5 weeks WFH(awaii) with our 20 month old daughter and grandma in tow. The house was comfortable, well stocked and easy to call home. The Internet was solid and we were both able to take video calls/meetings from anywhere in the house and out on the lanai with only the occasional lag. I rarely show up to an Airbnb where the real thing outshines the photos, but Luke’s property needs to be seen to be believed.

Our family spent all of July 2022 at this little slice of paradise. We were looking for a house that would feel like a home, located away from the major tourist areas yet not isolated, with direct water access and a pretty view such that we wouldn't have to jump in the car every day to have an adventure or go somewhere beautiful. This house provided all that, and so much more!  The house is a super cute, comfortable beach bungalow that "lives large" with an open concept living area inside, several functional and thoughtful outdoor areas, and lots of amenities included. The pictures on the listing are accurate - those are really the views! We enjoyed opening the doors and windows every day and letting the tradewinds breeze through the house. The huge outdoor dining table and grill were perfect for inviting our extended family (who live on Oahu) over for dinners. The kids (10 and 13) spent time in the water in front of the house every day checking out all the sea life. One day a monk seal came to nap on the beach!
During our month stay we explored the entire island of Oahu. If you are adventurers like us, be sure to get the local calendar so you can find neighborhood events that are not necessarily for tourists. Some of our best experiences were at local fairs like the state agricultural festival at Kualoa, an arts festival at Haleiwa, farmer's markets, and a children's hula school performance. In Honolulu we recommend the Bishop Museum. There are dozens of beaches for swimming, snorkeling, fishing, paddleboarding, and surfing. Kawela Bay and Kailua (north side) were favorites. Waimea Bay was another favorite for the kids (you can rock climb and cliff jump in addition to the gorgeous beach) but get there early.  In the summer, the North Shore is calmer and we spent many days in that area. Haleiwa town has a great barefoot vibe and good food. We kayaked to the Kaneohe Bay sandbar and Kapapa Island to spearfish for dinner and swim with the turtles (at a distance - please respect the laws created to protect marine life!). If you are a seasoned hiker, the Olomana Trail is a beautiful ridgeline trail with a hefty elevation change in a short distance. The Lanikai Pillbox trail was also fun, quick, and offers great views. If you like to get away from the crowds, don't miss Ka'ena Point (go at low tide so you can swim in the protected tidal pools). Local foodie? Head over to the Waihole Poi Factory or Adela's Country Eatery (all the handmade noodles are amazing - don't miss the lechon malunggay). And be sure to stop at Leonard's pink food truck in Kaneohe for malasadas!
Our local host, Nina, was wonderful. She was very responsive and went out of her way to address any (minor) issues that came up. She keeps the house well-stocked with supplies and is a great resource in general for questions about where to go, what to see, etc. Mahalo nui, Nina!
We'd love to come back someday. Aloha!

My family of four stayed five weeks at this house in June 2022 and it was a dream. From having a beautiful beach as your patio (watch for the turtles around 6-7 PM every day) to having everything we needed. 
If you are a morning person we highly recommend watching the sunrise. We saw so many at the house and it was magical.
We have a 7 and 9-year-old and I was concerned about toys and things for them to do when they were at the house. To my surprise, there were games, crayons, paint, kinetic sand, and much more. These are the type of details that make this house great. It's full of details. Same with the kitchen, beach equipment, etc. 
The house is more beautiful than the pictures and Nina is a 10 by any standard. She is so helpful and attentive. She is by far the best host I have ever had. 
My husband and our two kids really enjoyed every moment of this house. 
Advice for parents: use water shoes. The beach is amazing, but I always found little pieces of glass in the sand. We all had water shoes and it was fine. 
Thank you Nina and Luke for making our vacation perfect! We will be back! A hui hou!!

We stayed at the Chinaman’s House in Kaneohe, HI for the first 3 weeks of May 2022. We were three of us, my husband, my sister and I on this trip. It was our first Airbnb rental and it was absolutely great. Nina was the prefect host and by the end of the trip, she became a good friend to us. She was always responsive and diligent in taking care of all our needs. The house itself is spotlessly clean and well decorated. There are a lot of supplies, whether it is in the kitchen (spices, tea, coffee, etc.), bathrooms (soap, shampoo, conditioner, etc.) bedrooms (linens, blankets, pillows, etc.) or outside on the beach or water (kayaks, shoes, umbrella, floats, etc.). The view of the ocean from the huge picture windows in the living and dining room take your breath away. The lanai is perfect for entertaining or just sitting quietly at sunrise or sunset, watching the local fisherman get their catch for the day, or children playing in the beautiful regional park next to the house. My husband went for a long walk early every morning in this park. On weekends, large families of Hawaiian descent have picnics in the park and sing Hawaiian songs which are beautiful to hear. There are lovely beaches in this park where you can swim and fish. You can also swim at high tide near the house and the water is like silk. Sometimes, when there is bad weather, the ocean is a sight to see, with angry waves breaking on the rocks close to the house. There is a convenient gas grill on the lanai and it is such a pleasure to barbecue all kinds of fish, meat and vegetables every so often and eat it outdoors. The house is surrounded by a beautiful garden with all sorts of exotic plants and sweet smelling flowers. 
There is a very well stocked Safeway just 20 mins away by car in Kaneohe and all the big chain stores (Costco, Walmart, Whole Foods, etc.) are in Honolulu, which is a beautiful 30 min drive away from the house. The famous Kualoa Ranch is across the road in front of the house and has a beautiful mountain range and horses and cows that roam free on the ranch. There is a produce shop that sells wonderful vegetables, flowers, fish and meat that is grown on the ranch. There are local places nearby where you can buy delicious Hawaiian food, such as huli-huli chicken, pork lau-lau, kalua pig, and all different kinds of poke. We always bought fresh fruit (papayas, mangoes, pineapple, etc.) from the local fruit stands and sampling the different kinds of shaved ice is an absolute must. The Chinaman’s House is located far away from the hustle and bustle of a big city and is close to the beautiful Hawaiian culture and people, who are the most welcoming, gentle and helpful people we have ever encountered.
It is such a magical place to be in and we were all sad to leave the house and Nina. But, we hope to be back in the very near future.

We stayed at Nina and Luke's house during July and August 2021.  The size and layout were perfect for our extended family of seven (ages ranging from ten to eighty-five!).  As soon as we pulled into the driveway we were blown away by the amazing views.  On one side of the house were the mountains of Kualoa Ranch, where we were greeted by horses grazing just across the road.  And then on the other side of the house was the breathtaking ocean view and 
Mokoli'i island.  
The house was equipped with everything you need (a paddleboard, kayaks, bodyboards, life jackets, water shoes, snorkels, beach chairs, etc.) to enjoy the beach and ocean which was the "backyard" of the house.  There were tons of bath and beach towels, along with linens.  There was shampoo, conditioner and body wash at every shower.  The kitchen was stocked with all the basics to get you started for your stay (salt, oil, spices, sugar and coffee!).  
The house is perfectly situated to watch the sunrise.  Trips to Honolulu and the North Shore were easy drives from the house.  Although, we spent most of our time at the house! Amazing shaved ice just five minutes away, from a little shack on the side of the road.  The famous Poi Factory is just down the road as well as a Macadamia Nut Farm Store.  Absolutely the best location to enjoy the beauty of Hawaii! 
Nina was a gracious host!  She greeted us on our first night and was super attentive to whatever questions we had.  We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and a fruit basket.  As well as fresh flowers throughout the house.  All the little details and special touches made us feel so at home.  We will definitely be making this our home away from home during our next visit to Oahu!

We stayed at Luke's house from June 5-July 3, 2021. We brought our two children (ages 1 & 4) along with my mom on the trip. We live in Southern California by the beach & all of us were absolutely amazed by the ocean view upon arrival. It was absolutely breathtaking...  We are so glad that we arranged this trip and would 100% stay here again. We were so much more comfortable than we would have been at a resort (and we have stayed at many different resorts on the island of Oahu)... 
At the house, we had access to laundry, a kitchen, a BBQ along with many outdoor beach toys (kayaks, surfboards, SUPs, etc). Our 4 year old son really enjoyed using the kayaks to visit both Chinaman's Hat and Secret Island. 
In addition, we had access to a car and were able to go on many excursions during our stay. We went to the North Shore several times (Turtle Bay, Shark's Cove, Food Trucks, Pipeline/Sunset Beach, etc.). We did Hanuama Bay and we also did Wet N Wild several times (which the kids loved) as well as Waikiki, Ko Olina and Kailua. Luke's home is in between the Kualoa Mountain Range & the ocean. The views are unbelievable... Many tourists flock to this area to visit Jurassic Valley. We felt so lucky to be able to stay here. 
This is by far the best Airbnb we have ever booked and I am so thankful for the time we had as a family in this amazing location. 
Thank you Luke & Nina for your ongoing communication and for making sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. 
We hope to be back soon!

This beach house offered the best views we've ever had with a rental. Our hosts, were very attentive and gracious responding quickly if there was anything we needed. The house is bright and cheerful offering wonderful views of Chinaman's Hat from both the living room and deck. We had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay--lots of toiletries, stocked kitchen and plenty of towels and linens. Our 17 month old grandson loved being able to explore on the beach and play in the sand in the area on the lawn designated for sunning and sand play. Kualoa Ranch is directly across the street. We loved their market (great produce) and cafe and went there quite often during our stay. The house is adjacent to Kualoa Park which has a great beach and plenty of areas to stroll around and explore. We loved the location!

We stayed from April 6th - April 20th 2021. 
My husband and 3 kids(ages 14, 10 & 5) all loved this place as much as I thought they would. I fell in love with it as soon as I saw the listing. I knew with the space provided and the location, it was PERFECT for our family. When we arrived, my assumptions about its beauty were blown away. The photos are great, but they still can’t do this place justice. 
Waking up to a gorgeous view of Mokoli’i Island (aka Chinamans Hat) every single morning was a dream. Being able to put our feet in the water with our own little beach behind the house was so relaxing. And the house came with kayaks, sand toys and other things we were allowed to use. My husband and son kayaked to Mokoli’i island one morning and said the views from the top were awesome! 
The location is right on the main highway which we loved for the convenience, but you do hear cars at night. If you’re like me and need some white noise to sleep, this won’t bother you a bit! It’s also right across the street from Kualoa Ranch, so you get the beautiful mountains on one side and the water on the other. Nothing industrial like Honolulu. THIS place actually gives you the real feeling of being Hawaii. 
Whenever we go back, this is the place we’ll stay at again!

If you are lucky enough to find the Chinaman's Beach house available for your dates, you should not hesitate to book it! We had a wonderful time at the house and highly recommend it. The views are incredible and the outdoor space could not have been better. We traveled as a family of 9, with ages 9-67 and we all agreed that we hit the jackpot having stayed at this rental.  Nina was quick to respond to any question I had.  The house was clean, with comfortable beds and every amenity we could have needed. It had so many extra touches you normally do not find at rentals, such as beach toys, kayaks, life jackets, fresh flowers upon arrival, sunscreen, first aid kit, an outdoor shower, filtered water, nightlights throughout the house, an abundance of bath and beach towels, and the list goes on and on. Having the ocean on one side and Kualoa ranch on the other meant that we had activities galore nearby, and with two parking spots available for our car rentals, we could easily drive anywhere on the island. There are only two items I will note that I wish would be different, but they did not take away from how wonderful the house is: 1) The 2nd bathroom is off of the lanai and not accessible from inside the house. This made it very convenient for when we were enjoying the outdoors (which was the majority of the time), but with our large group, it was slightly inconvenient when we were getting ready for bed or first thing in the morning; 2) The bedrooms are in the back of the house near the road, so you do hear the cars passing by, but the AC's blocked off the noise and there were ear plugs provided, which we did not use. Other than that, I cannot think of anything else I would change. The house was very private and exactly what we needed to get away from our hectic daily lives.

Luke’s house is an absolute dream! This spotless beach house is located on the water with unobstructed views of Chinamans Hat island and the surrounding mountains. My husband and I loved jumping into the water from our backyard, and relaxing at our private sand beach. We also made good use of the kayaks, surfboards, etc that were provided on the property. (They basically have every type of beach toy you can think of, including plenty of things for kids)
My husband and I spent two months at Luke’s place while working remotely. Location-wise, we loved living away from the typical touristy spots, while experiencing a more authentic and pristine island life. Some of the most stunning hikes on the island are in the neighborhood, while Waikiki, Kailua and the North Shore were just an easy (and scenic) 30 minute drive away. 
Luke and Janina were wonderful hosts. Janina greeted us with a bottle of wine and bowl of fresh tropical fruit upon arrival. She was also very responsive to questions before and during our stay. The house is clean, bright and extremely well-appointed. Janina thought about every amenity. The bedrooms are close to the road, but the AC provided some nice white noise, and we had no issues sleeping. 
Hands down the best AirBnB we’ve ever stayed at in Hawaii (and we visit twice a year). The place looks even better than it does in the photos. We highly recommend it, and we’ll definitely be back!
