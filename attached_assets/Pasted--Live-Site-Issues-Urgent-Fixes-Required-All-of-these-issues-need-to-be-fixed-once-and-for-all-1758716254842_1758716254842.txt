## Live Site Issues â€” Urgent Fixes Required

**All of these issues need to be fixed once and for all and permanently. Do not make any other changes unless I specifically instruct you to.**

I've uploaded a screenshot of the current live homepage: [https://vacationrentaloahu.co](https://vacationrentaloahu.co)

Please address the following critical issues, which remain unresolved:

---

### 1. Changes Not Reflecting on Live Site
- When I republish the project in Replit, changes are **not reflected on the live site**: [https://vacationrentaloahu.co](https://vacationrentaloahu.co)
- It appears that all edits made in the **development environment** are correct and working as expected, but these updates are **not being published** to the live frontend.
- Actions:
  - Confirm that the deployment process is correctly configured to push changes to the production domain.
  - Verify that the build completes successfully and is targeting the correct environment.
  - Check for caching issues, DNS misconfiguration, or Replit hosting errors.

---

### 2. Booking Form Not Loading
- The booking form exists on the site but **fails to load properly**.
- This issue has been raised multiple times without resolution.
- Action: Ensure the booking form is fully functional and loads correctly on the frontend.
- It must also include **Stripe integration** so guests can complete a real booking with payment.

---

### 3. Property Images Not Displaying
- The correct property images are not appearing on the homepage.
- These images should be uploaded via the admin panel and displayed dynamically on the frontend.
- Action: Confirm that image upload, retrieval, and rendering logic are correctly implemented.

---

### 4. Amenities Not Showing
- The amenities section currently displays no content.
- Amenities must be entered through the admin panel and shown dynamically on the site.
- Action: Verify that amenities are saved and displayed correctly.

---

### 5. Map and Location Errors
- The embedded map is not functioning as expected:
  - It appears to display one map while trying to load another.
  - The property location radius is incorrect.
- Correct address to use:  
  `49-541 Kamehameha Hwy, Kaneohe, HI 96744`
- Current error from Google Maps:  
  `"The map is initialized without a valid Map ID, which will prevent use of Advanced Markers."`
- Additional Issue: Nearby attractions are not displayed.
- Actions:
  - Ensure the correct Google Maps API Key and a valid Map ID are in use.
  - Fix the map initialization error.
  - Confirm correct rendering of the location and nearby attractions.

---

### 6. Guest Reviews Not Displaying
- The guest reviews section is currently empty.
- Reviews must be added in the admin panel and displayed dynamically on the frontend.
- Action: Ensure that review data is present and correctly linked to the frontend component.

---

### 7. "Luxury" Wording Not Updated
- I've previously requested that the word **"luxury"** be removed or replaced throughout the entire site.
- This change has not been made.
- Action: Search the entire project (frontend and backend where applicable) and replace/remove all instances of the word "luxury" with the appropriate new wording.

---

### Final Checklist
- [ ] All data is synced between the admin panel and the frontend.
- [ ] Dynamic content (images, amenities, reviews, etc.) is rendering properly.
- [ ] External APIs (Google Maps, Stripe) are initialized with valid credentials.
- [ ] Booking and payment functionality (via Stripe) is fully operational.
- [ ] Deployment is successfully pushing updates to the live domain.
- [ ] All instances of the word "luxury" have been removed or replaced as instructed.

Please confirm once each issue is resolved or if further clarification is needed.
